# File Info

[Idioma Espa√±ol](./README.MD)

This is a small web application designed as an exercise to display file information. It supports txt files, PDFs, and images (including GIFs), and also offers language support for English and Spanish.

It displays file metadata, such as size in bytes and megabytes, name, and extension. For text and PDF files, it shows their content, and for image files, it displays the image on-screen.

There is a file size limit of 10 MB due to memory restrictions on Render.

It is deployed at: https://file-info.onrender.com.
